*In Level 10, you try to help Izzy play through all ten levels in each of five different video game worlds; each world is represented by a row of cards on the table. Players will play cards one by one to this 5x10 grid - 40 level cards and 10 reset cards - to (hopefully) complete the game. 
If a player cannot play a card on their turn, the players (and Izzy) lose.*

It's playable in the IDE.

Work in progress - not all win or lose conditions are implemented yet.

More info about the game on BoardGameGeek: [Level 10](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/211940/level-10)

## Usage
- Run the application and use inputs in the Run tool window to play the game.
- You can see the board with emotes representing the different worlds (lines).
- Each turn you play a card by typing in the specified number followed by Enter.
- You will get the info which new card is drawn.

- If you want to play a Reset Card you must type in R0 (for the first line) ... R4 (for the last line) followed by Enter.
- Then you are asked how many cards and which ones you would like to exchange with cards from the deck. For that first type in a number between 0 and 2 followed by Enter and then the indices of the cards, each followed by Enter.
