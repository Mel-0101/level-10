Level 10 is made by designer Hisashi Hayashi with artwork by Francisco Coda and Ryo Nyamo.

<i>In Level 10, you try to help Izzy play through all ten levels in each of five different video game worlds; each world is represented by a row of cards on the table. Players will play cards one by one to this 5x10 grid - 40 level cards and 10 reset cards - to (hopefully) complete the game. 
If a player cannot play a card on their turn, the players (and Izzy) lose.</i>
